# The University of Akron NASA Robotics Software Github
Welcome to the University of Akron's NASA Robotics github! The NASA Robotic Mining Team is a student-led engineering design team that designs and builds an autonomous robot for [NASA's lunabotics challenge](https://www.nasa.gov/learning-resources/lunabotics-challenge/), but most importantly engages students in progressing their engineering skills.
This git org contains the past and present code developed by the UA NASA Robotics team.
Check the current projects for posted issues. Issues will be catorgized by difficulty.
